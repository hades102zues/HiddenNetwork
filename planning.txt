1: Extend the message object so that state can be accomodated in the future.
    * Message has a field that details the size of the data in byte. 
    * This size field is determined within the constructor
    * The data member field should always be of DataType <>[].

2: Modify the send function to dissolve these additional fields in the byteArray.

--====Network Foundations
1. Storing basic socket details
    * Build a network class
    * Class stores : host machine, port and IP address
    * Function prints this basic info

2. Enet generate socket
    * Generate a socket / enet host
    * Test socket creation
    * Destructor destroys enet host

3. Basic Net Operations
    * Class Function for event sensing
    * Class Function for listening loop
    * Class Function for sending messages
    * Class Function for connecting to remote 

4. Basic Server-Client Handshake
    * Clients get a unique identifier
    * Unique identifier is incremented
    * Define an connection object that holds {id, peer}
    * Client info packed into a connection object
    * Dictionary holding connections <id, connection>
    * Remove disconnected clients from list

5. Message Object to be sent
    * Message should contain an clientServerId, messageType, data field
    * Logic to pack message data into a byteArray
    * Server and Network can send the msg object
    * Logic to unpack the message
    * Print the data

6: Extend the message object so that state can be accomodated in the future.
    * Message has a field that details the size of the data in byte. 
    * Message has a field that points to DataType [];
    * Modify the send function to dissolve these additional fields into the byteArray.
    * Modify the onMessage function to dissolve the updated byteArray;



--====Game Server Foundations
1. Time related basics
    A function to track system time
    A fixed delta time (in seconds)
